# nr1-browser-analyzer

![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer)

## Usage

nr1-browser-analyzer uses the `PageView` events in New Relic to interrogate and categorize the performance of a web site. You can explore the performance of individual pages, and forecast how improving performance impacts KPIs like bounce rate and traffic. This analysis is based on moving individual browsing sessions from `Tolerated` and `Frustrated` into `Satisfied` (as defined by the [`apdex`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) value for a given New Relic Browser application).
