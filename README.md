# nr1-browser-analyzer

![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-browser-analyzer)

## Usage

Using the [`Apdex`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) score generated by [`Browser's`](https://newrelic.com/products/browser-monitoring) _PageView_ event, Browser Analyzer displays an analysis of performance, and forecasts how performance improvements can impact Key Performance Indicators, like bounce rate or traffic.

This application allows you to explore the performance of individual site pages, and identifies improvement opportunities by showing which pages have the worst performance impact, allowing you to target high-impact fixes.
